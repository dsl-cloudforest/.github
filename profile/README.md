# Welcome Cloud Forest

The **dsl-cloudforest** organization is at the forefront of Cloud Computing research, specializing in sustainable practices with a strong emphasis on **Carbon-Aware Cloud Computing**. Our work focuses on optimizing cloud resource management through advanced techniques like workload scheduling, shifting, and migration to minimize environmental impact.

## What is DSL

The [Data Science Lab](https://www.datasciencelabs.org/) at Dong-A University aims to incorporate a knowledge graph into recommender systems. Our goal is to discover potential paths between users and items by exploring dynamic interlinks within an evolving knowledge graph. We apply various recommendation, analytics, and reasoning techniques to real-time processing of data streams and (quasi-)static datasets in areas such as air quality monitoring, smart energy monitoring, location intelligence, retail tech, carbon-aware-computing, massive online open courses, and more.

## Core Mission
